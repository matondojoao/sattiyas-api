Essence Shop API
</h1>

<p align="justify">
Built on Laravel, the Essence Shop API empowers your e-commerce platform with essential modules such as Products, Categories, Product Images, and Authentication.

**Authentication:** Essence Shop uses Sanctum for secure authentication. To test it on Postman, refer to the [API Documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/sanctum#main-content) on how to authenticate using Sanctum.

**Payments:** Essence Shop integrates with Stripe for payment processing. Check out the [Stripe PHP GitHub repository](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-php) for more details on processing payments with Stripe.

**Caching:** Essence Shop uses Redis for caching to improve performance and scalability.
