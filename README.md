Built on Laravel, the Sattiyas API empowers your e-commerce platform with essential modules such as Products, Categories, Product Images, and Authentication.

**Authentication:** Sattiyas uses Sanctum for secure authentication. To test it on Postman, refer to the [API Documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/sanctum#main-content) on how to authenticate using Sanctum.

**Payments:** Sattiyas integrates with Stripe for payment processing. Check out the [Stripe PHP GitHub repository](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-php) for more details on processing payments with Stripe.

**Caching:** Sattiyas uses Redis for caching to improve performance and scalability.
